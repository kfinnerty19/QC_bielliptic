# QC_bielliptic

This repository has an edited version of [Francesca Bianchi's](https://sites.google.com/view/francescabianchi) SageMath code, originally written for genus 2 bielliptic curves over Q whose Jacobians have Mordell--Weil rank 2. Bianchi's code is discussed in the paper ["Rational points on rank 2 genus 2 bielliptic curves in the LMFDB"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11635) by Francesca Bianchi and [Oana Padurariu](https://sites.google.com/view/oanapadurariu/home) [\[3\]](#References). Their code is available at: https://github.com/bianchifrancesca/quadratic_chabauty/blob/master/quadratic_chabauty_bielliptic.sage.

A first set of small edits were to handle the case of X_0(37) over Q(i), as J_0(37)(Q(i)) has rank 2, for the paper ["Oggâ€™s Torsion conjecture: Fifty years later"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04752) by [Jennifer Balakrishnan](https://math.bu.edu/people/jbala/) and [Barry Mazur](https://sites.harvard.edu/barry-mazur/), with an appendix by [Netan Dogra](https://sites.google.com/site/netandogra/) [\[2\]](#References). The code is available at https://github.com/jbalakrishnan/QC_bielliptic/tree/main

The set of edits in this repository are to generalize further to the case of genus 2 bielliptic curves whose Jacobians have Mordell--Weil rank 1 over Q and rank 2 over some quadratic field. We experimentally search for low-degree algebraic points as well. This repository is for the paper "Quadratic Chabauty Experiments on Genus 2 Bielliptic Modular Curves in the LMFDB" by [Kate Finnerty](https://katefinnertymath.com/), forthcoming in the 2025 LuCaNT proceedings [\[4\]](#References). 

The files qc_g2_bielliptic.sage and qc_g2_r1_bielliptic.sage are modified from the previous repositories as described below.  We investigate points that do not immediately correspond to rational points to see if they appear to satisfy algebraic relations. In the event we find such a point, we print the minimal polynomials of its coordinates.

If the curve has potential good reduction at a bad prime q, then the local height contribution at that prime can be understood entirely by information about the local height at a single Q_q-point on the curve. We check in MAGMA if the curve is locally soluble at q to confirm that such a point will exist. In the event that the code fails to obtain a Q_q point, we proceed to the general case to compute the height contribution at q. 

In each residue disc, we need to compute the function rho as described in Theorem 2.3 of Bianchi--Padurariu [\[3\]](#References). For the given point P, which is a F_p-point, we let Q denote the lift to the curve over Q_p. We let f_1 and f_2 denote the images of Q to E_1 and E_2 over Q_p. If, for one f_i, we have f_i multiplied by the order of E_i over F_p is the point at infinity, then we must compute the Coleman integral from the point at infinity to f_i. We speed up this computation by instead computing the Coleman integral from -f_i to f_i and multiplying the result by half. This is an extension of a lemma of Balakrishnan, Bradshaw, and Kedlaya [\[1\]](#References). 

There are some circumstances in which we must compute the Coleman integral from the point at infinity to a p-adic points on an elliptic curve. This step can be prohibitively computationally expensive for high precision. We implement a simplification to circumvent these difficulties with the point at infinity.

In the rank 1 case, we consider the height contributions of primes that divide the discriminant of the number field in use.

# Description of Files

- g2r1run.sage: loads a list of equations that are rank 1 over the rationals and runs the analysis for each of these. Suitable number fields are computed such that the Mordell--Weil rank of the Jacobian increases to 2. 

- g2r2run.sage: loads a list of equations that are rank 2 over the rationals and runs the analysis for each of these.

- qc_g2_bielliptic.sage: defines functionality to perform quadratic Chabauty on any genus 2 bielliptic curve given by an equation of the form `y^2 = a_6*x^6 + a_4*x^4 + a_2*x^2 + a_0`, with `a_i\in \ZZ`, such that the corresponding elliptic curves each have rank 1 and using a prime of good reduction.

- qc_g2_r1_bielliptic.sage: modifies the rank 2 version of the file to allow for one of the corresponding elliptic curves to have rank 0 provided that a suitable number field and a prime of good reduction is provided.

- rank1eqs.sage: a list of equations that are rank 1 over the rationals.
